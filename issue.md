# SMElib Notes

## EOS default list and placeholder molecular partition functions

`H3+` should not be included in the default EOS species list.

In the current EOS implementation, enabling `H3+` in the default network can drive the solution toward significantly larger `XNE`, `H-`, and `AHMIN`, which in turn makes Balmer lines much too shallow for cool-star cases such as Gmb1830.

The immediate practical workaround is to keep `H3+` out of the default EOS list unless its thermodynamic treatment is revisited.

Related note: `MOLCON` still contains many species with placeholder-style partition-function coefficients (for example constant `Q` behavior from `PCOEF = 1.0, 9*0.`-type entries).
These species should be audited systematically, especially hydrogen-bearing and charged molecules that can affect the electron balance.
